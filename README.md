# Coding Challenge Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to a variety of coding challenges from [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) and [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com/). The solutions are organized by platform and cover both algorithmic problems (in Python) and database problems (in SQL).

## Structure

- `LeetCode/` – Python and SQL solutions for LeetCode problems.
- `HackerRank/` – Python and SQL solutions for HackerRank challenges.

Each file is named according to the problem it solves for easy reference.

## Usage

Browse the folders to find solutions to specific problems. Each script is self-contained and can be run independently.
